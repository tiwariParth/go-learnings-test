# Week 4-5: Concurrency & Channels

## Weekly Objectives

- [ ] Understand Goroutines and their behavior
- [ ] Master channels for communication between goroutines
- [ ] Apply concurrency patterns
- [ ] Learn synchronization using `WaitGroup`, `Mutex` and `sync` package
- [ ] Build a concurrent URL checker tool

## Topics Covered

- Goroutines
- Channels (buffered/unbuffered)
- Select, `sync`, `WaitGroup`, `Mutex`
- Worker pools and fan-out/fan-in patterns

## Mini Project Goal

Build a **Parallel URL Checker Tool**:
- Check multiple URLs concurrently
- Implement worker pool pattern
- Track and report on response times
- Handle errors gracefully
- Output detailed status report

## Exercises

1. Implement a simple worker pool
2. Build a concurrent file processor
3. Create a timed-out context crawler

## Assessment

- MCQ on concurrency patterns
- Live coding simulation focusing on proper synchronization
