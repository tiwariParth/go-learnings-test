# Week 3: Intermediate Concepts

## Weekly Objectives

- [ ] Master Go functions and methods
- [ ] Understand pointers and references
- [ ] Learn struct composition and embedding
- [ ] Implement interfaces for polymorphism
- [ ] Build a config loader project

## Topics Covered

- Functions and methods
- Pointers and references
- Struct composition and embedding
- Interfaces and polymorphism

## Mini Project Goal

Build a **Go-based Configuration Loader**:
- Parse .env files
- Support multiple config formats (JSON, YAML)
- Use interfaces for flexibility
- Apply good error handling

## Exercises

1. Create a function that accepts pointer arguments and modifies values
2. Implement an interface hierarchy for different shapes
3. Build a struct composition example for a vehicle system

## Assessment

- Code review focusing on proper use of interfaces and pointers
